# cashlog - mini finance tracking app

mini finance web app to track money on accounts.

App let's user add entries about balances in accounts and displays some
simple time charts.

This really is just a scratch project for me to learn Rust basics (some of the
code is very clumsy) and to evaluate Rust as a Web Dev language: things like
difficulty, complexity, boilerplate, performance, stability. Just a silly toy
app.
